# Formula 1 Project Using Microsoft Azure

This repository contains a Formula 1 project demonstrating the integration of various Microsoft Azure services for data management, transformation, and analysis.

## Project Overview
This comprehensive project focuses on Formula 1 (F1) data ingestion from Azure Data Lake into Azure Databricks, leveraging PySpark for intricate data transformations within the Databricks environment. The transformed data is loaded into an SQL database within Databricks, enabling seamless visualization and analysis using PySpark SQL for generating insightful visualizations and reports entirely within the Databricks platform. This end-to-end workflow emphasizes the power of PySpark and SQL for managing, transforming, and visualizing F1 data in a unified Databricks environment, facilitating efficient and insightful data-driven decision-making processes.

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Ingestion**
    - Data is ingested from the Azure Blob Storage and the "eragast" website, capturing Formula 1-related data.
    - Utilizing Azure Databricks, the data is seamlessly transferred to Azure Data Lake Gen2.

2. **Data Transformation**
    - Azure Databricks is leveraged using PySpark and PySpark SQL for efficient data transformation.
    - PySpark and PySpark SQL functionalities are employed to clean, structure, and preprocess the Formula 1 dataset.

3. **Data Storage**
    - Processed and transformed data is stored within Azure Databricks for easy access and further analysis.

4. **Data Analysis**
    - Power BI is utilized to analyze the Formula 1 dataset residing in Azure Data Lake Gen2.
    - Power BI provides insightful visualizations and analytical capabilities to derive meaningful insights from the Formula 1 data.

## Project Setup Steps

### Prerequisites
- Access to Microsoft Azure portal.
- Appropriate permissions for creating resources like Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Gen2, Azure Databricks, and Power BI.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Azure Resources Setup**
    - Create an Azure Blob Storage account to store Formula 1 data.
    - Set up an Azure Data Lake Gen2 account for storing processed data.
    - Provision an Azure Databricks workspace for data transformation tasks.

2. **Data Ingestion**
    - Use Azure Databricks to establish data pipelines for ingestion from Azure Blob Storage and the "eragast" website to Azure Data Lake Gen2.

3. **Data Transformation**
    - Utilize Azure Databricks notebooks, PySpark, and PySpark SQL for data transformation tasks.
    - Clean, preprocess, and structure the Formula 1 dataset within Azure Databricks.

4. **Data Storage**
    - Store the processed data within Azure Databricks for easy accessibility.

5. **Data Analysis with Power BI**
    - Connect Power BI to Azure Data Lake Gen2 to visualize and analyze the Formula 1 dataset.
    - Create insightful dashboards and visualizations to explore the Formula 1 data.
