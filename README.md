# Formula 1 Project Using Microsoft Azure

This repository contains a Formula 1 project demonstrating the integration of various Microsoft Azure services for data management, transformation, and analysis.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The objective of this project is to showcase the end-to-end process of working with Formula 1 data, including ingestion, transformation, storage, and analysis, using Microsoft Azure services.

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Ingestion**
    - Data is ingested from the Azure Blob Storage and the "eragast" website, capturing Formula 1-related data.
    - Utilizing Azure Databricks, the data is seamlessly transferred to Azure Data Lake Gen2.

2. **Data Transformation**
    - Azure Databricks is leveraged using PySpark and PySpark SQL for efficient data transformation.
    - PySpark and PySpark SQL functionalities are employed to clean, structure, and preprocess the Formula 1 dataset.

3. **Data Storage**
    - Processed and transformed data is stored within Azure Databricks for easy access and further analysis.

4. **Data Analysis**
    - Power BI is utilized to analyze the Formula 1 dataset residing in Azure Data Lake Gen2.
    - Power BI provides insightful visualizations and analytical capabilities to derive meaningful insights from the Formula 1 data.

## Project Setup Steps

### Prerequisites
- Access to Microsoft Azure portal.
- Appropriate permissions for creating resources like Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Gen2, Azure Databricks, and Power BI.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Azure Resources Setup**
    - Create an Azure Blob Storage account to store Formula 1 data.
    - Set up an Azure Data Lake Gen2 account for storing processed data.
    - Provision an Azure Databricks workspace for data transformation tasks.

2. **Data Ingestion**
    - Use Azure Databricks to establish data pipelines for ingestion from Azure Blob Storage and the "eragast" website to Azure Data Lake Gen2.

3. **Data Transformation**
    - Utilize Azure Databricks notebooks, PySpark, and PySpark SQL for data transformation tasks.
    - Clean, preprocess, and structure the Formula 1 dataset within Azure Databricks.

4. **Data Storage**
    - Store the processed data within Azure Databricks for easy accessibility.

5. **Data Analysis with Power BI**
    - Connect Power BI to Azure Data Lake Gen2 to visualize and analyze the Formula 1 dataset.
    - Create insightful dashboards and visualizations to explore the Formula 1 data.
